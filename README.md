kinectlightpainting v 0.0
===================


As an initial stage for our project, we will try to simulate the effects of light painting where the user activates capturing mode, during which the hand movement is recorded, but only a short light trail is visible to the user, until the shutter closes (timer ends) and the user is able to see the whole path he/she has drawn. We will attempt to change the size of the trail according to the speed of movement (just like what happens in reality when we do light painting), so that the trail will become thinner when the movement is faster and vice versa. Different modalities will be used to bring the interaction closer to reality; the audio feedback will simulate the camera timer and shutter earcons and also the visual flashing red light feedback which notifies the user about the time they have left for the “shot”.
